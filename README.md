# Class Descriptions

- Menus Class: This is the user interface and primary logic center of the project. The main functionality of the file is
based off of interaction with a discussionPosts arrayList containing several post objects.
- Post Class: The post class is primarily a data class containing all relevant data to each post, comment, or subcomment.
These posts contain their own arrayList containing further post objects representing their comments section, as well as
two sister arrayLists containing the logins of the up and downvoters. These pieces of data are then manipulated by the
menus class.
- Data Class:
